<h1>1. Reduces stress</h1>
  <p><h4>Stress reduction is one of the most common reasons people try meditation. </h4></p>
  <p><h4>One review concluded that meditation lives up to its reputation for stress reduction.</h4></p>
  <p><h4>Normally, mental and physical stress cause increased levels of the stress hormone cortisol. This produces many of the harmful effects of stress, such as the release of inflammatory chemicals called cytokines.</h4></p>
  <p>
    <h4>
      These effects can disrupt sleep, promote depression and anxiety, increase blood pressure, and contribute to fatigue and cloudy thinking.
  </h4>
  </p>
<p class="double-space"><h4>In an 8-week study, a meditation style called “mindfulness meditation” reduced the inflammation response caused by stress.</h4></p>
<p><h4>Furthermore, research has shown that meditation may also improve symptoms of stress-related conditions, including irritable bowel syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder, and fibromyalgia.</h4></p>

<h1>3. Promotes emotional health</h1>
<p><h4>Some forms of meditation can lead to improved self-image and a more positive outlook on life.</h4></p>
<p><h4>For example, one review of treatments given to more than 3,500 adults found that mindfulness meditation improved symptoms of depression.</h4></p>
<p><h4>Similarly, a review of 18 studies showed that people receiving meditation therapies experienced reduced symptoms of depression, compared with those in a control group.</h4></p>
<p><h4>Another study found that people who completed a meditation exercise experienced fewer negative thoughts in response to viewing negative images, compared with those in a control group.</h4></p>
<p><h4>Furthermore, inflammatory chemicals called cytokines, which are released in response to stress, can affect mood, leading to depression. A review of several studies suggests meditation may also reduce depression by decreasing levels of these inflammatory chemicals.</h4></p>

<h1>4. Enhances self-awareness</h1>
<p><h4>Some forms of meditation may help you develop a stronger understanding of yourself, helping you grow into your best self.</h4></p>
<p><h4>For example, self-inquiry meditation explicitly aims to help you develop a greater understanding of yourself and how you relate to those around you.</h4></p>
<p><h4>Other forms teach you to recognize thoughts that may be harmful or self-defeating. The idea is that as you gain greater awareness of your thought habits, you can steer them toward more constructive patterns.</h4></p>
<p><h4>Additionally, experience in meditation may cultivate more creative problem-solving skills.</h4></p>
