      "I have a big test coming up and I don't know what to do. I don't have motivation to study for it. I know that if I don't study, I will fail, but I don't think I'm 
      in the right headspace for studying right now." - Anonymous

        I see you might be a bit stressed over that right now. It's ok to be stressed over a test. It's normal. I would say right now, do something you know will help you destress. 
        It could be meditating, doing a hobby, anything to help get your mind clear. Try to go back to studying once your mind is clear because forcing yourself to study when you're 
        not in the right mindset might be as good as if you didn't study at all. If your teacher allows it, maybe try emailing them and let them know about your situation. Try asking 
        if you could take it later. It doesn't hurt to try! You got this!

        "I have the worst sleeping habits in the whole world. I know they're bad, but I don't have the motivation to fix it. I enjoy being awake during really late hours of the night, but 
        it always leads me to sleeping through my alarms or feeling groggy in the morning. I always feel the most awake during these times and feel the happiest. I know I should fix it, but 
        I haven't found a reason to. I would like to think I'm taking care of my health well, but with my sleeping problems, I don't think I am. Should I fix the thing that makes me happy?" - Anonymous

      I see you're like an owl of the night! I see you say you have no motivation to try and fix your sleep schdule, but you've actually just wrote a reason! I don't know how important health 
      is to you (I'm hoping a lot), but that is a perfect reason! I know it might seem really hard letting go of the happiest times in a day, but trust me. It will be worth it in the long run. 
      You don't have to go all in at one time. You can do little by little. Maybe 30 minutes earlier each week until you land at a perfect medium? You don't have to start with a bang! If you're 
      worried about it, why not fix it while you can so you can go on without that burden! You can do this and remember you're most definitely not alone on this! Baby steps are still steps!

        "I'm a really big fan of many things and when I say big, I mean BIG. I've been told by my friends and family that I should "tone it down." I know that I can be a bit extreme at times, but I 
        don't know how. I've found genuine happiness in the things I'm a fan of. From music groups to tv shows, I express my love a lot. I don't want to be a ruckus to the people around me, but I also 
        don't want to give up the things that I love." - Anonymous

      Being a huge fan of something; I have a lot of experience as well. I understand that you have so much love for these things that your heart bursts with love and appreciation right? It's ok. You're not alone. 
      Right now, I want you to think about what you do when you see, listen, play, whatever you do to experience it. What do you do? Do you scream? Cry? Both? Or do you just do it peacefully? It's ok if you scream 
      or cry, as long as no one is going to complain or has anything important going on, go right ahead, but still be mindful of the people around you ok? Emotions are natural. My best tip for you right now would be 
      to make sure you don't let your emotions take over. I know sometimes that does happen, but if you catch yourself, stop, take a deep breath, and think about what's happening. If you think it is at an innappropriate 
      time and place, then try your best to calm yourself down. It's ok to slip up a few times. We're only human. Try your best and I'm sure it'll work out!
